FlickView is a mobile application developed as a project for the "Mobile Applications for the Android Platform" course. It's designed to showcase a gallery of images fetched from the Flickr Public Feed. Users are first presented with a curated selection of images deemed interesting by the Flickr community. After choosing the photo it showcases the description.  The app also retrieves detailed information about the authors of these images through a secondary API call.
